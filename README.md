# Detection of COVID-19 using chest X-Ray

This project aims to leverage chest X-ray images to develop a predictive model for COVID-19
diagnosis. By analyzing the characteristics and patterns observed in these images, the model
seeks to accurately predict whether a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19. The proposed
approach offers the potential for a faster and more accessible diagnostic method, especially in
areas where RT-PCR testing resources may be limited.
